Hey!

I am Vova, a backend engineer & quantitative developer. I am passionate about algorithmic trading and backend applications with Go and Python. Based in Wasrsaw, Poland.

Previously, I have completed my bachelor's degree in Economics at Belarusian State University and master's in Computer Science at Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology

Few years ago I [photographed](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RCW1Jpqh2t8KTnRtoNRIqf4y8PojCkrd?usp=sharing) on DSLR. Now trying to combine gym, tennis and swimming.

Also, I shoot on [film](https://www.flickr.com/photos/202925292@N02/).
